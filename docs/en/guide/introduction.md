---

A modern DOM manipulation library that truly supports **tree-shaking** for individual methods, with an API style similar to [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

## Migrating from jQuery

Domtify does not aim to be a 100% drop-in replacement for jQuery.  
There may be subtle differences (we call these “optimizations”).  
If you plan to migrate from `jQuery`, please make sure to read our [Migration Guide](./migration.md).

## Package Name Origin

The name **domtify** was inspired by the Vue-based UI component library [Vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify):

- `vuetify` = `vue` + `tify`
- `domtify` = `dom` + `tify`

We share the origin of the name just to make it more memorable.

## Browser Support

domtify supports all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Changelog

Detailed change logs for each version can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/domtify/domtify/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
